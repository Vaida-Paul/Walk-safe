# Walk Safe - Cluj Napoca

Walk Safe is an innovative app created as part of the "M100 Cities - InnovateTech for Climate" hackathon. Our goal is to provide the safest and most eco-friendly routes for citizens of Cluj Napoca, ensuring a healthier, more sustainable urban experience.

## Team

This app was built by a team of 5 developers working together to improve the urban mobility experience for the people of Cluj Napoca.

## Features

- **Optimal Routes**: Walk Safe uses a custom algorithm to generate the best route from point A to point B, ensuring that users travel through the safest zones and the "greenest" areas in the city.
- **Leaflet Map**: The app displays a dynamic map of Cluj Napoca using the Leaflet library, allowing users to interact with the city's streets and parks.
- **User Accounts**: Users can create and log in to their accounts to save their preferences and access personalized routes.
- **Progressive Web App (PWA)**: Walk Safe is a PWA, meaning it can be downloaded and used on any device, whether desktop or mobile.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React, CSS
- **Backend**: C# Web API
- **Graph Creation & Optimization**: Python
- **Map Visualization**: Leaflet

## How it Works

1. **User Authentication**: When users enter the app, they can log in or register a new account.
2. **Route Creation**: Once logged in, users can mark two points on the map: a starting point and a destination point.
3. **Route Generation**: After selecting the points, users click the "Generate Route" button, and the app calculates the best route between those points, ensuring that it prioritizes safety and green spaces.
4. **PWA Support**: The app can be used on both desktop and mobile devices, and can also be downloaded as a PWA for offline access.
